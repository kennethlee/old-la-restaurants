LA Historic Restaurants 
========================

LALALA food is good, so are crazy old restaurants! yum!„ÄÄüç¥üç©üíé

We are making a map for the Offbeat L.A. blog, whose author, Nikki, has compiled this list of historic L.A. restaurants, [Offbeat L.A.: The Oldest Surviving Los Angeles Restaurants‚Ä¶ A Master List of the Vintage, Historic and Old School](http://thelosangelesbeat.com/2015/05/offbeat-l-a-the-oldest-surviving-los-angeles-restaurants-a-master-list-of-the-vintage-historic-and-old-school/) 

Link of work so far: [Map](http://maptimela.github.io/old-la-restaurants/)

So far...
==========
- Search and categorize restaurants by whether they are open now or not
- Sort and filter restaurants by decade. Let users be able to choose a decade and see just those restaurants.
- Search, log and add photos/links from [LA Public Library](http://www.lapl.org/collections-resources/visual-collections/menu-collection) old archived menu exhibit online database
- Search, log and add historic photographs, current photographs, links to YouTube videos of the restaurants
- Make an extra-fun food-themed old-fashioned `Mapbox Studio` layer
